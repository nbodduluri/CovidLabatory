# CovidLabatory
Create a software where lab employees and lab testers can get their companies individual covid case data. The system includes a regristration for employees and the lab technicians. Once registered indivuals can sign up for the test and then the technicians will input the test results into the software. For faster testing, we do batch testing by splitting pateints into pools. Once results are out, the employee can log in to see his or he test result.
